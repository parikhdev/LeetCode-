# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Practice

This repository contains my daily solutions to LeetCode problems.  
The goal is to **solve at least 1 problem every day**, improve my DSA skills,
and track my long-term progress publicly.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Solve 1 LeetCode problem every day  
- Improve problem-solving skills  
- Learn data structures & algorithms  
- Build consistency and discipline  
- Track progress using GitHub commits  

## 📌 Notes
I will keep improving:
cleaner code
more optimal solutions
comments & explanations
using multiple approaches for the same problem

## ⭐ Motivation
“Consistency beats intensity.”
Even one problem a day compounds into huge improvement.
